1. Single Row Subquery

SELECT FirstName, Salary FROM Employees WHERE Salary = (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM
Employees);

Finds employees with the highest salary.

2. Multiple Row Subquery

SELECT FirstName FROM Employees WHERE DepartmentID IN (SELECT DepartmentID FROM
Departments WHERE Location = 'Chennai');

Lists employees working in Chennai departments

3. Multiple Column Subquery

SELECT FirstName, DepartmentID FROM Employees WHERE (DepartmentID, ManagerID) IN
(SELECT DepartmentID, ManagerID FROM Departments WHERE Location = 'Mumbai');

Compares multiple columns (only supported in some databases; SQL Server may need join instead)

4. Correlated Subquery

Depends on the outer query and is executed for each row of the outer query.

SELECT E1.FirstName, E1.Salary FROM Employees E1 WHERE Salary > ( SELECT AVG(Salary)
FROM Employees E2 WHERE E1.DepartmentID = E2.DepartmentID);

Finds employees earning more than their department's average.

5. Subquery in FROM Clause

Used to treat a subquery as a temporary table.

SELECT DepartmentID, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary FROM ( SELECT DepartmentID, Salary
FROM Employees) AS Temp GROUP BY DepartmentID;

Calculates average salary by department.

6. Subquery in SELECT Clause

Used to compute a derived value for each row.

SELECT FirstName, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Projects WHERE Projects.EmployeeID =
Employees.EmployeeID) AS ProjectCount FROM Employees;

Shows number of projects per employee.
